I am a visual learner. I learn visually. I cant learn through audio. This has been ingrained in my mind since childhood. I originally studied textbook illustration! Visual learning has been integral to a part of me as a student and tutor, giving well illustrated speeches and drawing illustrations as I tutored chemistry and anatomy. But, what if I really only just liked these 
drawings? What if everyone was getting the same amount of knowledge out of these diagrams. 
	
	My first experience in college I tried to be very visual study heavy. My study guides and notes were extremely in depth and illustrated. I studied guides and diagrams for hours because I’m a visual learner. But, I also was studying very visual fields. As my learning has gone beyond biology and art, I have found that podcast listening is actually an excellent way for me to study Japanese. When I was stuck into the mindset that I was a visual learner, I genuinely believed audio help wouldn’t do anything for me. It wasn’t until I stepped away from studying that I learned I had been depriving myself of so much material!
	
	Although we may have study preferences, I think the deepest truth is that teaching is the best way to study. You only know what you know. There are so many strategies to study many different subjects. But practicing knowledge shows you know it. When studying for my EMT I always act out processes- because that is how you use your knowledge. When Studying Japanese I like to talk to native speakers- because that is how I use that knowledge. When I study anatomy I look at the diagrams and learn to label them visually- because that is how you use the knowledge. These study styles seem like more of a product of from we are studying rather than a way to go about studying. Everyone is a bit unique in how they study, but breaking out of your study style shell and just following advice from people who’ve had success might be just as effective.
